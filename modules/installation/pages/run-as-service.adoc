*Axion* can be set up to run as service. 

For example, in Linux:

. Create a systemd unit file.
+
....
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/axion.service
....
The unit file should contain, for example: 
+
....
[Unit]

[NOTE]
====
. If you need to use *Axion* in developer mode with H2 DB, remove lines with _postgresql.service_ in the _Unit_ section of the unit file.
. Make sure that *Axion* version and location directory is mentioned correctly in the unit file.
====

. Your system service has been added to your service. Reload the systemctl daemon to read the new file. Reload command:
+
....
sudo systemctl daemon-reload 
....

. Run *Axion* as a service with command:
+
....
sudo systemctl start axion.service
